# Upcoming changes that you should know

Hello podStation users!

In case you have not noticed, I have not implemented new features in podStation in quite a while.

Despite a long list of improvements I'd like to do, the fact is podStation needs an overhaul before I can do any more meaningful improvements to it.

This is in part because it is based on some old stuff, but more important than that: Due to a change in Chrome's browser extension APIs, **I must update podStation** from Manifest V2 to Manifest V3 until June 2024[^manifest-v2-timeline], in case I want to keep podStation alive.

I have started some groundwork[^mv3-milestone] for this in the past, but lost track of it due to other priorities.

If you would like to help, the best way is to boost my motivation by:

- Leaving a review with a comment of encouragement on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/podstation-podcast-player/bpcagekijmfcocgjlnnhpdogbplajjfn)
- Following and sharing your love for podStation on social media, mentioning one of the following accounts:
    - Mastodon ([@podStation@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@podstation))
    - Twitter ([@podStation_app](https://twitter.com/podStation_app))
    - Facebook (<https://www.facebook.com/podStation>)
- Giving it a Start on GitHub (<https://github.com/podStation/podStation>) 

Wish me luck in this endeavour, I'm not sure yet if I'll be able to make it in time, it is a huge undertaking.
